# What is this Repository?
This repository summarizes what I studied while taking the machine learning course, which was the first semester of 2022. Main Course is Machine Learning, but it also includes Data Mining too. 

# What includes?
+ Data Mining Homework => About Odds, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
+ Machine Learning Homework => About Clustering, Decision Tree
It also contains Python and R Code

# Used Data
+ Data Mining for Linear Regression => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
+ Data Mining for Logistic Regression => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset?datasetId=306&sortBy=voteCount
+ Machine Learning for Clustering => https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
+ Machine Learning for Decision Tree => https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset

# Details of Data Mining Homework
## Odds
+ Talking about Odds and how odds apply in real life
## Linear Regression
+ Before building a model, Data preprocessing and EDA
+ Build Linear Regression and interpret a model
+ After building first model, do feature selection and compare with others.
#### Using MAE, MSE, ANOVA, p-value
## Logistic Regression
+ Before building a model, Data preprocessing and EDA
+ Build Logistic Regression and interpret a model
+ After building first model, do feature selection and compare with others.
+ Find proper Cut-off
### Using confusion matrix, AIC, BIC, p-value

# Details of Machine Learning Homework
## Clustering
+ Data preprocessing and EDA
+ Clustering Analysis with KMeans, hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
+ make an intuitive comparison(because of unsupervised learning) and using Silhouette score, V-measure
+ Hyperparameter tuning

## Decision Tree
+ Data preprocessing and EDA
+ make an outlier of 3 percent (Professor's homework requirements)
+ Build a model and compare(ex. if prune? or not?)
+ evaulate model with confusion matrix
+ Interpreting models with graphviz
+ Hyperparameter tuning for gridsearch
